It connects to the client-side application (`simpleserv-client`) to display system status, execute commands, and provide power management options (Power Off, Restart).
It serves as the dashboard interface for monitoring system performance, running commands, and triggering actions remotely.

This host application is intended to be used in conjunction with the `simpleserv-client`. The **client** runs on the target machine, gathering system data and executing commands, while the **host** is the interface for interacting with the system remotely. You can access it via a web browser on your local machine.

- To access the web control panel, open your browser and visit:  
  `http://localhost:6969`

- **Note**: Make sure the `simpleserv-client` is running on the target machine and on the same wifi network as the host.
